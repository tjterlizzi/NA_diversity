# Repository for files used to generate the maps seen in Figures 1 and 6
Within this repository are all of the files used to generate the maps used within Terlizzi and Minckley (2025). The files were processed within ArcGIS Pro. quat_plant_map.aprx is the project file used to generate Figures 1 and 6. To open the files. Download this folder and open quat_plant_map.aprx using ArcGIS Pro. This folder contains all of the required files to generate the figures. The quat_plant_map.gdb folder contains all of the shape files and rasters used to generate the map figures. The Laurentide ice sheet shape files were downloaded from Batchelor et al. (2019; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11601-2). The North American coastline shape files were derived using sea level data from Cutler et al. (2003; https://doi.org/10.1016/S0012-821X(02)01107-X). Ecoregion shapefiles for North America and Guatemala were based on EPA level I and level II maps published to the EPA website: https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregions-north-america. Guatemala shapefile was based on mapping by Griffith et al. (1998). The publication is no longer available online, however a pdf is uploaded within the folder named citation.
