# Smoothed Site Data

The spreadsheets contained within this folder are the output of the smoother within the smth_data_v2_Brewer.RMD file. Each spreadsheet is derived from the rawdata folder and then smoothed to a 1000-year interval with a uniform time range from 0 to 150,000 years ago. The smoothed pollen proportions of these datasheets are used in all of the other R Markdown scripts to generate the analyses discussed in Terlizzi and Minckley (2023).
