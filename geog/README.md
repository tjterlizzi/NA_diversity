# Geographic distribution of plant diversity
site_coord.csv contains the geographic coordinates for each of the records used in Terlizzi and Minckley (2025). The MIS average plant diversity files generated from the figure_code.RMD file are stored here. These files were then used to generate the maps shown in Figure 6.
