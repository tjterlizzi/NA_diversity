# Site pollen records with absent taxa

This folder contains all of the site pollen records used in Terlizzi and Minckley (2023) but all sites share the same species list. As such there are a number of empty columns in each site for taxa that are not present in one site but present in another.

These spreadsheets were not used in the analysis of Terlizzi and Minckley (2023).
