# Site Pollen Records
The spreadsheets stored within this folder are the pollen records for each of the North American sites accessed from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database. 
Each spreadsheet contains the relative proportions for each pollen taxon as well as the depth within the core. 
Each spreadsheet has been manually cleaned, with raw pollen counts being converted to relative proportions and taxa with abundances less that 1% or associated with aquatic environments being removed from the records and proportion calculations.
These spreadsheets contain the data used in the raw_smth_calc.RMD script to generate the smoothed datasets used in the analyses of Terlizzi and Minckley (2025).
