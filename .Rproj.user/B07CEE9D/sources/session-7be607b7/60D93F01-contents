# Trait Observation Data
This is where the trait data for all of the taxa used in this study will be saved. Trait data is taken from the BIEN Database.
Larger taxa files are compressed and uploaded as .ZIP files.
The pinus taxon file was too large to be uploaded even as a .ZIP. Please reach out to the authors for access to the files or generate them using the BIEN_trait_import.RMD file in this repository.
